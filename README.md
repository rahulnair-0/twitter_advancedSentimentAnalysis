This repository contains a project focused on sentiment analysis of tweets from Twitter. The goal is to classify tweets into five categories: positive, negative, neutral, racist, and sexist. By expanding the classification beyond the regular sentiment analysis, we aim to identify and analyze tweets that contain racist or sexist content.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we apply sentiment analysis to tweets from Twitter. The regular sentiment analysis classifies tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment expressed in the text. However, our project goes a step further and adds two additional categories: racist and sexist. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the sentiment behind tweets related to these sensitive topics.
